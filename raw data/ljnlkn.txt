Nowadays most of e-commerce sites, networks and online communities require only a user name and
static password for login and access to personal and sensitive data, where the login with such credentials is known as one
factor authentication, as the user is required to know only one thing to get accessed. Although this one-factor authentication
method is convenient, it is not secure because of online identity thefts, where users are targeted by miscreants, besides they
face some attacks like eavesdropping, phishing attack, spoofing, man in the middle attack, replay attacks, denial of services
and virus attacks, these attacks are increasing throughout the world [1]. Therefore, this paper presents a two-factor
authentication method where an additional security credential is added to address the limitations of static passwords (onefactor authentication). This paper proposes a model of Random Image Based Password Authentication (RIBPA) to
generate an image-based One-time password (OTP) which is a password that is valid for only one login session or
transaction within certain period of time and is created by using images. The proposed model requires the user to log in
first with his credentials (user name & password), then he/she has to use his/her additional security credential, which is the
generated image-based OTP to complete his/her authentication process. The OTP is generated by using three random
images uploaded by the user at each time he/she logs in. The time of the OTP generation is 3 seconds which is a great
achievement compared to other proposed models, and it will be valid for only one login session or transaction, and expired
after 60 seconds. The proposed model is developed using MATLAB, and was tested on HP G72 Notebook PC under
Windows 8 operating system.
